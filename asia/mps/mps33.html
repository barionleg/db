<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1054">1054</A></FONT></span>P&#8217;hatman, Usen's wife, met him in front of the door, joyful she saluted him, she showed her pleasure; they greeted each other, they went in and seated themselves. As I have observed, his coming annoyed not Dame P&#8217;hatman.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1055">1055</A></FONT></span>Dame P&#8217;hatman was attractive to the eye, not young but brisk, of a good figure, dark in complexion, plump-faced, not wizened, a lover of (female) minstrels and singers, a wine-drinker; she had abundance of elegant gowns and head-dresses.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1056">1056</A></FONT></span>That night Dame P&#8217;hatman entertained him right well. The knight presented beautiful gifts; they that received them said: "They are worthy!" P&#8217;hatman's entertainment of him was worth while; by God! she lost not. When they had drunken and eaten, the knight went outs to sleep.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1057">1057</A></FONT></span>In the morning he showed all his wares, he had them all unpacked; the fairest were laid aside for the king, he had the price counted out; he said to the merchants: "Take them away!" He loaded them, (and) had them carried away. He said: "Sell as ye will; reveal not who I am!"</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_171"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 171</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1058">1058</A></FONT></span>The knight was clad as a merchant; he was by no means dressed in his proper raiment. Sometimes P&#8217;hatman calls on him, sometimes he visits P&#8217;hatman. They sat together; they conversed with refined discourse. Absence from him was death to P&#8217;hatman, as Ramin's was to Vis.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_29"></A><A HREF="#fn_29"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>
